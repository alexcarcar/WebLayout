<h1>Glossary</h1>
<ul>
    <li><label>Prototype and patch:</label> A development plan that involves writing a rough draft
        of a program, testing, and correcting errors as they are found.
    </li>
    <li><label>Planned development:</label> A development plan that involves high-level insight into
        the problem and more planning than incremental development or prototype development.
    </li>
    <li><label>Pure function:</label> A function that does not modify any of the objects it receives
        as arguments. Most pure functions are fruitful.
    </li>
    <li><label>Modifier:</label> A function that changes one or more of the objects it receives as
        arguments. Most modifiers are fruitless.
    </li>
    <li><label>Functional programming style:</label> A style of program design in which the majority
        of functions are pure.
    </li>
    <li><label>Invariant:</label> A condition that should always be true during the execution of a
        program.
    </li>
</ul>
