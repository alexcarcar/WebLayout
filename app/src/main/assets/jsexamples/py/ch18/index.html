<ul>
    <li><label>Encode:</label> To represent one set of values using another set of values by
        constructing a mapping between them.
    </li>
    <li><label>Class attribute:</label> An attribute associated with a class object. Class
        attributes are defined inside a class definition but outside any method.
    </li>
    <li><label>Instance attribute:</label> An attribute associated with an instance of a class.</li>
    <li><label>Veneer:</label> A method or function that provides a different interface to another
        function without doing much computation.
    </li>
    <li><label>Inheritance:</label> The ability to define a new class that is a modified version of
        a previously defined class.
    </li>
    <li><label>Parent class:</label> The class from which a child class inherits.</li>
    <li><label>Child class:</label> A new class created by inheriting from an existing class; also
        called a "subclass."
    </li>
    <li><label>IS-A relationship</label> The relationship between a child class and its parent
        class.
    </li>
    <li><label>HAS-A relationship</label> The relationship between two classes where instances of
        one class contain references to instances of the other.
    </li>
    <li><label>Class diagram:</label> A diagram that shows the classes in a program and the
        relationships between them.
    </li>
    <li><label>Multiplicity:</label> A notation in a class diagram that shows, for a HAS-A
        relationship, how many references there are to instances of another class.
    </li>
</ul>
