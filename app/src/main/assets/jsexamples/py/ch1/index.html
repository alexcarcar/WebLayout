<h1>General Notes</h1>
<ul>
	<li><label>Problem solving</label> means the ability to <label>formulate problems</label>, <label>think creatively</label> about solutions, and <label>express</label> a solution clearly and accurately</li>
	<li>Examples of <label>high-level languages</label>: <code>Python, C, C++, Perl,</code> and <code>Java</code>
		<ul>
			<li><label>High-level languages</label> are easier to program and are <label>portable</label></li>
			<li><label>Interpreters</label> reads a high-level program and executes it</li>
			<li>A <label>compiler</label> reads a program and translates it completely before running</li>
			<li>The high-level program is called <label>source code</label> and the translated program is called <label>object code</label> or the <label>executable</label></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><label>low-level languages</label> are also referred to as <label>machine languages</label> or <label>assembly languages</label></li>
	<li>Python is an interperter that can be used in <label>interactive mode</label> or <label>script mode</label></li>
	<li>The <label>chevron,</label><code>>>></code> is the <label>prompt</label> that the interpreter uses to indicate that it is ready</li>
	<li>A <label>program</label> is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation</li>
	<li>Programming errors are called <label>bugs</label> and tracking them down is called <label>debugging</label></li>
	<li><label>Natural languages</label> are languages not "designed" by people, but evolved naturally (i.e. English, Spanish, French)</li>
	<li><label>Formal langues</label> are languages designed by people for specific applications.</li>
	<li><label>Programming languages</label> are <label>formal languages</label> that have been designed to express <label>computations</label></li>
	<li><label>Tokens</label> are basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements</li>
	<li><label>Structure</label> in a language refers to the way the tokens are <label>arranged</label></li>
	<li><label>Parsing</label> is the process of figuring out the structure and meaning of statements in a language</li>
	<li>In the statement "The penny dropped", "the penny" is the <label>subject</label> and "dropped" is the <label>predicate</label></li>
</ul>
<h1>Basic Components of Most Computer Languages</h1>
<ul>
	<li><code>input:</code> Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device</li>
	<li><code>output:</code> Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device</li>
	<li><code>math:</code> Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication</li>
	<li><code>conditional execution:</code> Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code</li>
	<li><code>repetition:</code> Perform some action repeatedly, usualy with some variation</li>
</ul>
<h1>Three Types of Programming Errors</h1>
<ol>
	<li><label>Syntax Errors</label>
		<ul>
			<li><label>Syntax</label> refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure</li>
			<li><code>(1 + 2)</code> is legal, but <code>8)</code> is a <label>syntax error</label></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><label>Runtime Errors</label>
		<ul>
			<li>Does not occur until the program has started running</li>
			<li>These errors are also called <label>exceptions</label></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><label>Semantic Errors</label>
		<ul>
			<li>Runs without error messages, but does not do the right thing</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<h1>Differences between Formal and Natural Languages</h1>
<ul>
	<li><label>Ambiguity:</label> Natural languages are full of ambiguity. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous</li>
	<li><label>Redundancy:</label> To reduce ambiguity, natural languges employ lots of redundancy.  Formal languages are less redundant and more concise</li>
	<li><label>Literalness:</label> Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor.  Formal languages mean exactly what they say</li>
</ul>
<li>Differences between Poetry and Prose</li>
<ul>
	<li><label>Poetry:</label> Words are used for their sounds and meaning, and the whole poem creates an effect or emotional response.  Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate</li>
	<li><label>Prose:</label> The literal meaning of words are more important, and structure contributes more meaning.  Prose are more amenable to analysis than proetry but still ambiguous</li>
	<li><label>Programs:</label> Programs are unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of tokens and structure</li>
